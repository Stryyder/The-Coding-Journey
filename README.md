### Projects I'm working on

* [View the Wiki page](https://github.com/Stryyder/The-Front-End-Coding-Journey/wiki)
for updates and progress

#### Primary

- Client sites: Work ongoing
- freeCodeCamp Learning Project [calculator](https://github.com/Stryyder/js-calculator)

#### Secondary

- Balmoral 2D Baseball: Learning basic graphics setup for Unity (shifted to Godot for this as it runs more smoothly)
- Squirrel-Book will replace the clunky Mega-Cheat project (considering React for this)
- [Novice-Movie-Study](https://github.com/Stryyder/novice-movie-study) is a low priority JSON log of movies I've watched over the years with some basic associated data and gut reaction ratings


### Completed Projects

**Create-React-App**
- [Drum Machine](https://github.com/Stryyder/drum-machine)
- [Markdown Previewer](https://github.com/Stryyder/markdown-previewer) - utilizing [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)
- [Random Quote Machine](https://github.com/Stryyder/random-quote-machine) - My first ever React project

**Vanilla JS**
- [Jabroney](https://github.com/Stryyder/Jabroney): This is a snake-like game where you collect stuff. Work ended. Fun project, but the more I learn, the more embarrassed I am of its ugly code and structure. It's also a very rudimentary game. Up to three players locally - [play now!](https://jabroney.netlify.com)
- [It's A Bug](https://github.com/Stryyder/ItsABug):  My first jump into JavaScript and the canvas.  This project was extremely educational.  I learned a lot of what-not-to-dos. [play now!](https://itsabug.netlify.com)
- [simply-morse](https://github.com/Stryyder/simply-morse) is a text/morse converter (open for PRs)

**HTML/CSS/JS**
- [Mega-Cheat](https://github.com/Stryyder/Mega-Cheat): Mega-Cheat is currently a pretty ugly little cheat sheet for basic fron-end development. It needs some love but work has halted to work on a client site (React looks promising to componentize this)

**Flash/Actionscript**
- [Jeaopardy Test Prepper](https://github.com/Stryyder/Jeopardy-Flash-Cards): This project was originally designed for a game night, but could also be used to study for a test, or teach a class. It utilizes Flash.

**Basic**
- [Danger House](https://github.com/Stryyder/Danger-House): I made this game with Basic utilizing at the time QBasic 4.5. It was made sometime around 2001? Text and pictures - they were all the rage back then.

### Biggest lessons so far
- Equally important to studying is not studying everything.  Trying to learn everything is futile.
- Algorithm and data structures are such a vital key component to learn that they should be placed up front
- You may experience something deeper than burnout, fear of not being able to grasp the material. But you can. Each time you come across a term, it becomes more and more familiar as time passes.
- Even if web dev dies in the future, programming won't
- Before applying to jobs, have a solid portfolio and a job-specific, targeted resume
- Learn at the speed required to fully comprehend the material
- A creative side-project that isn't necessarily educationally focused can help keep you excited about coding
- Just work locally first and then make more meaningful, content-rich commits to repositories! 

### Biggest challenge so far
- Javascript Algorithms
- React oddities (going through this section twice in bootcamp was extremely beneficial)
- Redux state management is odd


#### Basic Front-End Developer Path
- Build a Portfolio Site
- Work on projects, even for free (like open source stuff even)
- Put Your Code on a portal like GitHub
- Go to community coding events
- Network with other developers
- Follow industry news and stay on top of the newest skills
- Refine your resume
- Start looking for a job
- Interview, interview, interview
- [Check this out](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) for a much better, exhaustive list of what to learn.
