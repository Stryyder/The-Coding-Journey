## NOTE
- The examples included here are not scrubbed to perfect. They are just "working" solutions that passed the current test.

### Biggest lessons so far
- You may experience something deeper than burnout, fear of not being able to grasp the material. But you can. Each time you come across a term, it becomes more and more familiar as time passes.
- Even if web dev dies in the future, programming won't
- Before applying to jobs, have a solid portfolio and a job-specific, targeted resume
- Learn at the speed required to fully comprehend the material
- A creative side-project that isn't necessarily educationally focused can help keep you excited about coding

### Biggest challenge so far
- Javascript Algorithms

### Project Statuses
- Mega-Cheat: Commencing work Tuesday after a recovery day
- Jabroney: Work ended. Great project, but the more I learn, the more embarrassed I am of it.
