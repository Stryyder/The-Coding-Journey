# The Front-End Coding Journey
An ongoing log of my progression into the coding world
- This repo will primarily consist of the wiki, with maybe some coding samples along the way.
* [View the Wiki page](https://github.com/Stryyder/The-Front-End-Coding-Journey/wiki)
for updates and progress

## NOTE
- The examples included here are not meant to be the best solution, just A solution that I could figure out on the first try. I'm hoping that my solutions become more well thought out and advanced as time passes.


### Biggest lessons so far
- You may experience something deeper than burnout, fear of not being able to grasp the material. But you can. 
- Even if web dev dies in the future, programming won't
- Before applying to jobs, have a solid portfolio and a web dev focused resume
- Learn at the speed required to fully comprehend the material

### Project Statuses
- Job status: I currently have two jobs, both of which don't pay much
- Mega-Cheat: Prepartion for second job has postponed any serious progress
- Jabroney: Work halted to get better at coding


### Current Focus
- Intermediate algorithms with JavaScript - really struggling with these. More practice, more, more, more.
  I fully understand solutions when I see them, but coming up with the structure on my own has been challenging.
- Preparing for a forced break from coding during the entire month of June
