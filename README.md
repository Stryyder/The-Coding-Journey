**Vanilla JS**
- [Jabroney](https://github.com/Stryyder/Jabroney): This is a snake-like game where you collect stuff. Work ended. Fun project, but the more I learn, the more embarrassed I am of its ugly code and structure. It's also a very rudimentary game. Up to three players locally - [play now!](https://jabroney.netlify.com)
- [It's A Bug](https://github.com/Stryyder/ItsABug):  My first jump into JavaScript and the canvas.  This project was extremely educational.  I learned a lot of what-not-to-dos. [play now!](https://itsabug.netlify.com)
- [simply-morse](https://github.com/Stryyder/simply-morse) is a text/morse converter (open for PRs)

**HTML/CSS/JS**
- [Mega-Cheat](https://github.com/Stryyder/Mega-Cheat): Mega-Cheat is a cheat sheet for basic fron-end development. It needs some love. (Open for first-timer PRs, but will not be actively maintained)

**Flash/Actionscript**
- [Jeaopardy Test Prepper](https://github.com/Stryyder/Jeopardy-Flash-Cards): This project was originally designed for a game night, but could also be used to study for a test, or teach a class. It utilizes Flash.

**Basic**
- [Danger House](https://github.com/Stryyder/Danger-House): I made this game with Basic utilizing QBasic 4.5 and prior versions. Text and pictures - they were all the rage back then. Some of the graphics for this game were created by: unknown artist.
