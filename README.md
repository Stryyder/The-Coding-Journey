# The Front-End Coding Journey
An ongoing log of my progression into the coding world
- This repo will primarily consist of the wiki, with maybe some coding samples along the way.
* [View the Wiki page](https://github.com/Stryyder/The-Front-End-Coding-Journey/wiki)
for updates and progress

## NOTE
- The coding chunks supplied with this project are a track record of progress more than anything. Some aren't pretty, but I'm hoping that it will show a progression in logic and psuedo-coding during this process. The "solutions" provided are to algorithm questions at freeCodeCamp. It has been very helpful to finish the problems on my own first, then go to the hint pages to see how I could have done it a lot better.


### Biggest lessons so far
- Learn how to learn / rebuild the wheel ony if the old one is beyond repair
- You may experience something deeper than burnout, fear of not being able to grasp the material. But you can. 
- Even if web dev dies in the future, programming won't
- Before applying to jobs, have a solid portfolio and a web dev focused resume
- Learn at the speed required to fully comprehend the material

### Project Statuses
- Job status: I currently have two jobs, both of which don't pay much
- Mega-Cheat: Prepartion for second job has postponed any serious progress
- Jabroney: Work halted to concentrate on JAM
- Baseball game: Awaiting completion of boot camp

### Current Focus
- Intermediate algorithms with JavaScript - really struggling with these. More practice, more, more, more.
  I fully understand solutions when I see them, but coming up with the structure on my own has been challenging.
- Preparing for a forced break from coding during the entire month of June
