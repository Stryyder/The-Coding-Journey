# The Front-End Coding Journey
An ongoing log of my progression into the coding world

for updates and progress

## NOTE
- The examples included here are not meant to be the best solution, just A solution that I could figure out on the first try. I'm hoping that my solutions become more well thought out and advanced as time passes.


### Biggest lessons so far
- You may experience something deeper than burnout, fear of not being able to grasp the material. But you can. Each time you come across a term, it becomes more and more familiar as time passes.
- Even if web dev dies in the future, programming won't
- Before applying to jobs, have a solid portfolio and a job-specific, targeted resume
- Learn at the speed required to fully comprehend the material

### Project Statuses
- Job status: I currently have two jobs, both of which don't pay much
- Mega-Cheat: Commencing work Tuesday after a recovery day
- Jabroney: Work ended. Great project, but the more I learn, the more embarrassed I am of it.


### Current Focus
- Intermediate algorithms with JavaScript - really struggling with these. More practice, more, more, more.

- As the field gets more and more complicated in front of me, I'm reaching the conclusion I need to specialize even further. UX/UI, AWS, etc. There are so many avenues to approach. Choosing one is intimidating.

- New career shift in November will further derail solid progress temporarily
