# The Front-End Coding Journey

for updates and progress

## NOTE
- The code examples included in this project are not perfect. They are just "working" solutions that worked to succesfully pass that specific challenge in coding bootcamp. As I progress, I will likely revisit these solutions and rework them, improving upon their efficiency, etc.

Many of them, too, are just examples for me to reference later as a what-to-do or what-not-to-do.

### Biggest lessons so far
- You may experience something deeper than burnout, fear of not being able to grasp the material. But you can. Each time you come across a term, it becomes more and more familiar as time passes.
- Even if web dev dies in the future, programming won't
- Before applying to jobs, have a solid portfolio and a job-specific, targeted resume
- Learn at the speed required to fully comprehend the material
- A creative side-project that isn't necessarily educationally focused can help keep you excited about coding

### Biggest challenge so far
- Javascript Algorithms
- React oddities (going through this section twice was extremely beneficial)
- Redux state management is odd


#### Basic Front-End Developer Path
- Build a Portfolio Site
- Work on projects, even for free (like open source stuff even)
- Put Your Code on a portal like GitHub
- Go to community coding events
- Network with other developers
- Follow industry news and stay on top of the newest skills
- Refine your resume
- Start looking for a job
- Interview, interview, interview
- Check [this](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) out for a much better, exhaustive list of what to learn.

### Projects I'm working on
- Balmoral 2D Baseball: Learning basic graphics setup for Unity
- [Mega-Cheat](https://github.com/Stryyder/Mega-Cheat): Mega-Cheat is currently a pretty ugly little cheat sheet for basic fron-end development. It needs some love but work has halted to work on a client site (React looks promising to componentize this) 
- Client site: Skeleton in place - Working on performance tweaks - learning React may help
- [Jabroney](https://github.com/Stryyder/Jabroney): This is a snake-like game where you collect stuff. Work ended. Fun project, but the more I learn, the more embarrassed I am of its ugly code and structure.
