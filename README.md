# The Front-End Coding Journey
An ongoing log of my progression into the coding world
This repo will primarily consist of the wiki, with maybe some coding samples along the way.
* [View the Wiki page](https://github.com/Stryyder/The-Front-End-Coding-Journey/wiki)
for updates and progress

### Biggest lessons so far
- Learn how to learn / rebuild the wheel ony if the old one is beyond repair
- You may experience something deeper than burnout, fear of not being able to grasp the material. But you can. 
- Even if web dev dies in the future, programming won't
- Before applying to jobs, have a solid portfolio and a web dev focused resume
- Learn at the speed required to fully comprehend the material

### Project Statuses
- Job status: I currently have two jobs, both of which don't pay much
- Mega-Cheat: Work continues on dev branch
- Jabroney: Work halted to concentrate on JAM
- Baseball game: Awaiting completion of boot camp

### Current Focus
- Intermediate algorithms with JavaScript - as day job consumes most of my time
  I fully understand solutions when I see them, but coming up with the structure on my own has been challenging.
- Preparing for a forced break from coding during the entire month of June
