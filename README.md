## The Front-End Coding Journey
An ongoing log of my progression into the coding world
This repo will be primarily consist of the wiki, with maybe some coding samples along the way.

### Why

There is so much information out there that the exact path to your first job as a front-end developer can be a nightmare. You are told you have to learn this, that, the other thing, and know how to slice bread with a different framework each day. This project is an ongoing log of what it takes for me (a 40 year old man with a lot of other challenges besides coding) to get into the industry. I truly hope to show that anyone, absolutely anyone (even a slightly dense old dog like me) can learn new tricks and do this stuff. I have a long way to go. Join me if you like!
