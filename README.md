# The Front-End Coding Journey
An ongoing log of my progression into the coding world
This repo will primarily consist of the wiki, with maybe some coding samples along the way.
* [View the Wiki page](https://github.com/Stryyder/The-Front-End-Coding-Journey/wiki)
for updates and progress

## Why
There is so much information out there that the exact path to your first job as a front-end developer can be a nightmare. You are told you have to learn this, that, the other thing, and know how to slice bread with a different framework each day. This project is an ongoing log of what it takes for me (a 40 year old man with a lot of other challenges besides coding) to get into the industry. I truly hope to show that anyone, absolutely anyone (even a slightly dense old dog like me) can learn new tricks and do this stuff. I have a long way to go. Join me if you like!

### Biggest lessons so far
- Even if web dev dies in the future, programming won't
- Before applying to jobs, have a solid portfolio and a web dev focused resume
- Learn at the speed required to fully comprehend the material

### Project Statuses
- Job status: I currently have two jobs, both of which don't pay much
- Mega-Cheat: Work continues on dev branch
- Jabroney: Work halted to concentrate on JAM
- Baseball game: Awaiting completion of boot camp

### Current Focus
- Intermediate algorithms with JavaScript
- Preparing for a forced break from coding during the entire month of June
