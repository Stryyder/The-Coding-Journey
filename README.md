for updates and progress

## NOTE
- The code examples included in this project are not perfect. They are just "working" solutions that worked to succesfully pass that specific challenge in coding bootcamp. 

### Biggest lessons so far
- Everyone is lost to a certain degree
- You may experience something deeper than burnout, fear of not being able to grasp the material. But you can. Each time you come across a term, it becomes more and more familiar as time passes.
- Even if web dev dies in the future, programming won't
- Before applying to jobs, have a solid portfolio and a job-specific, targeted resume
- Learn at the speed required to fully comprehend the material
- A creative side-project that isn't necessarily educationally focused can help keep you excited about coding

### Biggest challenge so far
- Javascript Algorithms
- React oddities

### Projects
- 2D Baseball Game: Building a team to round out development skills and processes
- Mega-Cheat: Work halted to work on a client site (React looks promising to componentize this) 
- Client site: Laying the foundations
- Jabroney: Work ended. Great project, but the more I learn, the more embarrassed I am of it.
